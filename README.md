# JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS

These are a few of the assigned projects I made using JavaScript

## Projects

 - [Pizza Menu](Pizza_Project)
 - [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](TicTacToe)
 - [Calculator](calculator.html)

## Pizza Menu
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings and sizes, and outputs the total price when the order is submitted.

## Tic-TacToe Game
Classic tic-tac-toe with a kitty twist. The opponent just randomly places circles wherever the player hasn't. Once the player or computer gets three in a row, or cat's game, the round ends and the winner starts the new game.

## Calculator

Basic 4-function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a classically styled calculator.
